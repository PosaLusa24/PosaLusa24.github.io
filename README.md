# So this is my website

Most of the time, you should see something similar to an about page (yes the one with my face as the background), a low-key philosophical blog, and a list of side projects that I haven't already given up on.

I say *"most of the time"* because I use this website as a testing ground for trying out new web technologies. So if you happen to see a `404 not found`, it's because the site's under development and definitely not because I messed up a routes file somewhere.

## Tools

Current website is built with JAMstack using:
- SSG: [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/)
