# So this is my website

Most of the time, you should see something akin to an about page (yeah, the one with my face as the background), a low-key philosophical blog, and a list of side projects that I haven't already given up on.


## Tools

Current website is built with JAMstack using:
- SSG: [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/)
- CSS: [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Framework: [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)

Builds from `source` and deploys to `master` using GitHub Actions:
- [setup-node](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-node-js-environment)
- [actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action)
- [checkout](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout)
